Handle errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.
Maintain a user-friendly interface for ease of use.
### Key Activities:
- Define Requirements:Determine the operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Design User Interface:Sketch a layout for the calculator,design buttons for each operation and digits.
- Testing:Perform unit tests on arithmetic functions,test the user interface for usability and functionality
#### Technology Used:
- programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python), development tools (IDE, libraries).
